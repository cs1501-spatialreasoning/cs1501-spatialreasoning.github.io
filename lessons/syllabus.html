					<p>
						<strong>Course Description</strong> <br/>
						Spatial reasoning skills are strongly correlated with success in computer science, especially that the introductory levels. This is because, in many instances, professors use spatial reasoning terms and ideas while teaching computer science. Thus, many students, who didn’t develop these skills at a younger age, are at a disadvantage. <br/>
						We have designed this course in conjunction with Professor Tychonievich to help everyone improve their skills!
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Pre-Requisites</strong> <br />
						We have no formal prerequisites, however students who have not completed CS2150 may benefit the most from this course! No computer science skills or knowledge is required to have fun and do well in this class.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Course Instructors</strong> <br/>
						Rohit Musti - Computer Science Major (rm3qg@virginia.edu) <br />
						Isabel Alvarez - Computer Science Major (ia2ew@virginia.edu) <br />
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Professor of Contact</strong> <br />
						If a student has a significant issue with the course, grades, or instructor, contact the course professor. <br />

						<strong>Grading Policy </strong> <br />
						Attendance: 50 points<br />
						Homeworks: 25 points<br />
						Activities: 25 points<br />
						If there is any problem fulfilling these grading requirements, please speak to one of the course instructors and we will work students on a case-by-case basis.
					</p>

					<p><strong>Note: </strong> The below set of lessons is subject to change and only list 12/14 weeks of the Fall 2018 semester. This is to create a time buffer so we are able to fit in all the material. It is likely that we will cover more material than what is described below.</p>

					<hr>

					<p>
						<strong>Week 1</strong> <br />
							Introduction to why we are offering the course. <br />
							Overview of topics to be covered. <br />
							What “work” to expect inside and outside of the class. <br />
							Play tetris (highest score gets candy). <br />
							Quick diagnostic test to measure where we are starting (for instructors to measure our progress).
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Week 2</strong> <br />
						Explanation of how sketching can improve spatial reasoning.<br />
						Drawing activity.<br />
						Pictionary!<br />
						Homework 1: Draw any object in your dorm from 3 different perspectives.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Week 3</strong> <br />
						We want you draw thornton from the aerial perspective, from the front (facing the street) and  from the side (facing engineers way). <br />
						Build a model of thornton using toothpicks and marshmallows.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Week 4</strong> <br />
						Mental rotations. <br />
						We are going present a series of 2d images of 3d models on a powerpoint. <br />
						Game involving rotating the images. <br />
						if the images are rotated correctly in the correct order, then they will spell out a message. <br />
						Homework 2: Rotate a series of images from a pdf to spell out a word or draw a picture and submit the final result
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Week 5</strong> <br />
						Cross Sections! <br />
						Explain the concept of cross sections.<br />
						Show different types of images on the board and have students match them with cross sections. <br />
						Activity: each student makes their own objects out of playdough and then draws the cross section (we will cut them to check).
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Week 6</strong> <br />
						Game day! <br />
						Congrats on making half way through the semester. <br />
						Explanation of how video games improve spatial reasoning. <br />
						Activity: play various first person video games and arcade classics. <br />
						Brief diagnostic test for instructors to measure progress and tinker with any methods.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Week 7</strong> <br/ >
						Spatial relations. <br />
						Explanation of relations between objects. <br />
						Activity: Take various play-dough objects and attach them to create larger structures. <br />
						Homework 3: Given a structure diagrammed from 3 perspectives, create it using play-dough and take a photo from each perspective.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Week 8</strong> <br />
						Lego week. <br />
						Explain how Legos help improve spatial reasoning. <br />
						Activity: Use legos to build giant fortresses.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Week 9</strong> <br />
						Explain how mazes relate to and improve spatial reasoning. <br />
						Activity: Navigate 5 mazes in class. <br />
						Homework 4: Create a maze for homework.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Week 10</strong> <br />
						Given your mazes that you made for homework, create them using your choice of materials. <br />
						Showcase: everyone can try to solve each other’s mazes.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Week 11</strong> <br />
						Jigsaws! <br />
						Explain how jigsaws relate to and can improve spatial reasoning. <br />
						Activity: Assemble several jigsaw puzzles.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Week 12</strong> <br />
						Done! <br />
						Take final diagnostic test! <br />
						Play games like tetris and other first person games from throughout the semester. <br />
						Fill out feedback form. <br />

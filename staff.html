					Hi! My name is Rohit Musti and I am a 3rd year computer science major in the College of Arts and Sciences. I discovered my love for teaching as a TA for CS 1110 and wanted to explore this passion further. Creating this course has been a fantastic step in that direction. Three words to describe me: curious, excitable, and kind. If you have any questions about this course, college, or life in general, don't hesitate to reach out!

					I am a fourth year computer science student at the School of Engineering. Throughout my academic career, I have had the opportunity to work as an assistant preschool teacher, a college-level tutor, and a teaching assistant at UVa. I have always had an
					interest for education; and being able to teach this class is an excellent opportunity to help other students learn more about the topic of spatial reasoning.</p>

            I'm an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Virginia. I earned a
						Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Virginia, M.S. and B.S. degrees in computer
						science from Brigham Young University, and A.A. and A.S. degrees from Lakeland Community College.

					<p style="color: black; padding-left: 12.5%; padding-right: 12.5%; text-align: left; ">
						My primary academic activity is education: education of students, teaching assistants, faculty, and computer science educators at every level. My research has three main thrusts. In computer science education I research pedagogical practices and course designs that attract more and more diverse students into computing. As part of FHISO and rootsdev I research data models for facilitating large-scale cooperative family history research. I am also a theoretician and algorithmist, having developed algorithms and written proofs on several topics within computing.</p>
